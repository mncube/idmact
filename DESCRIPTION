Description: Using an analytic method to investigate the difference between mean
  scale scores and raw scale scores for different forms of an assessment can be
  challenging due to different maps between raw scores and scale scores for
  different forms, complex mathematical relationships between raw scores and
  scale scores, the inclusion of adjustments based on judgemental procedures,
  and different equating functions being used on different forms of the assessment.
  Another approach is to run simulations to investigate the the effect that
  incrementing raw scores has on mean scale scores. The 'idmact' package provides
  an implementation of the algorithm outlined in Schiel(1998)
  <https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/ACT_RR98-01.pdf>. The
  idmact_subj() function provides a framework for running simulations on subject
  level scores while the idmact_comp() function provides a framework for running
  simulations on composite scores.
